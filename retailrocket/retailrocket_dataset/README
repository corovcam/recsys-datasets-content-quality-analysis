SUMMARY & USAGE LICENSE
=============================================

This dataset is provided by Keagle through the link: https://www.kaggle.com/retailrocket/ecommerce-dataset

The data has been collected from a real-world ecommerce website by Retail Rocket (retailrocket.io). It is raw data, i.e. without any content transformations, however, all values are hashed due to confidential issues. The purpose of publishing is to motivate researches in the field of recommender systems with implicit feedback. 

The behaviour data, i.e. events like clicks, add to carts, transactions, represent interactions that were collected over a period of 4.5 months. A visitor can make three types of events, namely “view”, “addtocart” or “transaction”. In the original dataset, there are 2,756,101 events including 2,664,312 views, 69,332 add to carts and 22,457 transactions produced by 1,407,580 unique visitors. 


This data has been organized and cleaned up by Arthur Fortes [1] similar to the MovieLens 100k treatment [2], 
which removed all users and items who had less than 10 and 40 interactions, receptively and separated 
in files the type of events. 

Detailed descriptions of the data file can be found at the end of this file.
 
This dataset consists of:
  * 92,490 interactions from 3,431 users on 8,885 items.
    - History: 3,423 users and 8,878 items (78,372 accesses) 
    - Purchase: 824 users and 3,077 items (5,089 interactions)
    - Add to cart: 1,557 users and 4,447 items (9,029 interactions)
